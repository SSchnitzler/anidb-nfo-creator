# AniNFO #

AniNFO, hosted by the project anidb-nfo-creator, is a small Java Utility intended to help Anime fans using the Boxee software create NFO files for their collection of Anime videos. Because of the current databases which the Boxee software uses it is very poor at recognizing Anime series or movies and populating the necessary data to sort and categorize these files within the Boxee interface. AniNFO will parse the file and search the AniDB Database for the relevant series and episode information to be able to generate the NFO files which Boxee can then use to properly sort and organize these files.
