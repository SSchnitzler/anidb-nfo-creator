# Requirements #

AniNFO is programmed using Java 1.7, it may run under older versions of Java but this has not been tested. The use of the Java language should allow AniNFO to run on most operating systems with little difficulty.

Because AniNFO makes extensive use of the AniDB API for obtaining required data an internet connection is required for this application to work fully. Future releases may get remove this requirement to some degree by allow the user to manually update and edit details on the files but that will be far more time consuming and monotonous.. meaning you might as well just make the files if you are doing it that way.

Also, due to restrictions of the API created by the AniDB team, a username and password for their site will be required. You can register on their website at http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=signup
