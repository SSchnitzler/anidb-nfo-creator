# File Naming #
Files must use one of the two formats:

**Series Name.E##<.title>.ext**

In this format E## will be the Episode number. AniDB does not use seasons but the AniNFO interface will allow you to manually set season numbers to episodes if you choose. Otherwise they will all be listed under Season 1. Title is also an optional portion of the name. Basically, anything after the E## will be ignored for the most part as titles will be pulled from the AniDB database.

**Series Name.#x##<.title>.ext**

In this format the #x## is Season x Episode Number, for example 1x04. Once again, since AniDB does not use Season numbers that will be primarily ignored and the Episode# will be referenced against the AniDB database. And again, Title is optional as largely anything after the episode number will be ignored.

At this time, the addition of a (####) to indicate year of release is not being parsed so it is recommended that you do not include these in your file names.
